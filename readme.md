# Purpose of this repository

### Learning C
- This is my absolute first experience with C. And this seemed like a good exercise to learn C with. There is managing a bunch of strings, getting network requests, parsing and storing the data.

### Learning Emacs (apparently) 
- If learning C wasn't destabilizing enough, I'm also learning to use emacs. So far at the point of writing this it has been 2 days, I got evil-mode working so its been a pretty smooth transition. (this has nothing to do with this repo I guess...

;; Maybe by that time I'm finished working with this I'll want to do this in lisp :)

### Making myself a "robust" offline are.na proxy.
- I have a sort of working node implementation of this. But I think it will be more fun* to do this in c.

*painful

### Learning CMD line gymnastics
I wanna implement something like the [are.na-cli](https://github.com/ivangreene/arena-cli/blob/master/index.js), and then maybe play around with some sort of org more integration or smth will be fun. I think just playing with a terminal vibe for are.na will be fun.

# So what is this (planned features)

# Why do I keep coming back to the Are.na API
